Revision history for Perl extension Net::Oping.

1.01  Sun Jan 27 16:08:03 2008
	- Have `Makefile.PL' exit if the header file <oping.h> cannot be found
	  _before_ a Makefile is generated. This is done because
	  `ExtUtils::MakeMaker' doesn't check whether libraries exist and this
	  seems to be the standard way of dealing with this. A (hopefully)
	  informative message is written to STDERR in this case.

1.00  Sat Jan 26 13:52:11 2008
	- The module has been renamed from `Oping' to `Net::Oping'.
	- The XS code has been simplified and a high-level interface has been
	  created in Perl.

0.01  Wed Oct 24 01:32:19 2007
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23.
